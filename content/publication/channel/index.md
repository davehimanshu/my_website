abstract: We investigate the mechanisms by which inertial particles dispersed at semidilute conditions cause significant drag-reduction in a turbulent channel flow at $\mathrm{Re}_\tau=180$. We consider a series of four-way-coupled Euler-Lagrange simulations where particles having friction Stokes number $\mathrm{St}^+ = 6$ or 30 are introduced at progressively increasing mass loading from $M = 0.2$ to 1.0. The simulations show that $\mathrm{St}^+ = 30$ particles cause large drag-reduction by up to 19.74\% at $M = 1.0$, whereas $\mathrm{St}^+ = 6$ particles cause large drag increase by up to 16.92\% at $M = 1.0$. To reveal the mechanisms underpinning drag-reduction or drag-increase, we investigate the stress distribution within the channel and the impact of the dispersed particles on the near-wall coherent structures. We find a distinctive feature of drag-reducing particles which consists in the formation of extremely long clusters, called ropes. These structures align preferentially with the low-speed streaks and contribute to their stabilization and suppression of bursting. Despite the additional stresses due to the particles, the modulation of the near-wall coherent structures leads to a greater reduction of Reynolds shear stresses and partial relaminarization of the near-wall flow. In the case of the drag-increasing particles with $\mathrm{St}^+ = 6$, a reduction in Reynolds shear stresses is also observed, however, this reduction is insufficient to overcome the additional particle stresses which leads to drag increase. 

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We investigate the role of inertial particles within a semi-dilute particle-laden turbulent channel flow at $\mathrm{Re}_\tau = 180$ and show significant drag reduction or increase. The increase of decrease in drag is dependent on particle inertia while the magnitude of change in drag is dependent on the mass loading.
